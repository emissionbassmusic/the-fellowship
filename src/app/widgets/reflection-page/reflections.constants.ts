Many shortcomings tempt me daily; therefore, I also have daily opportunities to become aware of them. In one form or another, many of my character defects appear daily: self-condemnation, anger, running away, being prideful, wanting to get even, or acting out of grandiosity.<br><br>Attempting half measures to eliminate these defects merely paralyzes my efforts to change.

It's not that I wanted the help so much at the time; I simply did not want to hurt like that again. My desire to avoid hitting bottom again was more powerful than my desire to drink.

I saw \"them\" at meetings — after all, that was where \"they\" existed. I shook hands with \"them\" and, when I went out the door, I forgot about \"them.\"<br><br>Then one day my Higher Power, whom I did not then believe in, arranged to create a community project outside of A.A., but one which happened to involve many A.A. members. We worked together, I got to know \"them\" as people. I came to admire \"them,\" even to like \"them\" and, in spite of myself, to enjoy \"them.\" \"Their\" practice of the program in their daily lives — not just in talk at meetings — attracted me and I wanted what they had. Suddenly the \"they\" became \"we.\" I have not had a drink since."

I stumbled through the doors of A.A. in disgrace, expecting nothing from life, and I have been given hope and dignity. Miraculously, the only way to keep the gifts of the program is to pass them on."

I see it in the eyes and hear it in the voices of those around me. By working the program I find the direction and strength with which to make it mine.
